# 66 Days of Data   

Five minutes a day for 66 days. Spending a few minutes every day learning something new about data.  This is supposed to develop a new habit. We will see. Seems I slipped into 10 minutes a day, oops.

## Clustering

1. Day 1 - Visualization of wine data, preparing to cluster  (23-Oct-2021)
2. Day 2 - Clustering the wine dataset with k-nearest neighbors (24-Oct-2021)
3. Day 3 - KMeans on the Wine data (25-Oct-2021)
