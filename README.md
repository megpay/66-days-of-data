# 66 Days of Data

## What happened?

It looks like I got super busy at work and let this slide. Not to say that I haven't been coding, I have, I just haven't been recording it. I am going to give this another go.


### Back then

Five minutes a day for 66 days. Spending a few minutes every day learning something new about data.  This is supposed to develop a new habit. We will see. Seems I slipped into 10 minutes a day, oops.

## Clustering
